# To-Do-list

This is a to do list project that has following functions.
1. The task could be added through the add button and hit "enter" on you keyboard;
2. The task could be modified by clicking the pencil icon on the task pannel and hit "enter" to update the task;
3. The task could be checked by clicking the check box, and would be unchecked when clicking once again;
4. The task could be deleted when clicking the cross icon at the end of the task pannel, or deleted by all by clicking the "remove all" button;
5. The task pannel could display three different tasks, which is "All", means all task; "Completed", means checked and completed task; "Active", means unchecked task;
6. The task could be saved when the page is closed and would store the previous page once the tab is reopened.
